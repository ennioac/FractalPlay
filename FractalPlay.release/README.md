## **Fractal Play and Python**

v1 Ennio Cellucci 2025-07-20

Just a simple play script for Python with Pandas and Plottly Express for some fractal fun.  Also a Jupyter Notebook version,  also for fun.  Should work  immediately if you're running the Anaconda distribution of Python for any platform else install modules in “requirements” file.
